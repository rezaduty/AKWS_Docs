detailed workflow for taking screenshots of web applications using Eyewitness and Aquatone, and to generate this workflow using the Llama 3 8B model via the VLLM library, follow the pattern below. This includes setting up the LLM model, defining the prompt for generating the workflow, and running the model to get the output.

Code for LLM Model Setup and Prompt for Screenshots Workflow

```python
from vllm import LLM
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Load the Llama 3 8B model
model = LLM("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct")

# Load the tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct")

# Define the prompt for creating a screenshot workflow with Eyewitness and Aquatone
prompt_content = """
You are a security analyst tasked with creating a detailed workflow for taking screenshots of web applications using two tools: Eyewitness and Aquatone. Please provide a comprehensive step-by-step guide that includes:

1. **Tool Setup**:
   - How to install and configure Eyewitness and Aquatone.
   - Any required dependencies or configurations.

2. **Taking Screenshots with Eyewitness**:
   - Detailed command-line instructions for running Eyewitness to capture screenshots of web applications.
   - Expected outputs and interpretation.

3. **Analyzing Screenshots with Aquatone**:
   - Detailed command-line instructions for using Aquatone to analyze and generate reports from screenshots.
   - Expected outputs and interpretation.

4. **Combining Results**:
   - How to combine and interpret the results from both tools to get a comprehensive view of the captured web application screenshots.

**Example Workflow**:
1. **Install Eyewitness and Aquatone**:
   - Commands: `pip install eyewitness`, `gem install aquatone`
   - Configuration: Ensure both tools are properly installed and accessible.

2. **Run Eyewitness**:
   - Command: `eyewitness --web --urls https://example.com --output /path/to/output`
   - Expected Output: Screenshots saved to the specified directory.

3. **Run Aquatone**:
   - Command: `aquatone -d example.com -out /path/to/aquatone/output`
   - Expected Output: Report generated with screenshots and visual analysis.

4. **Analyze Results**:
   - **Combine Outputs**: Review the screenshots and reports from Eyewitness and Aquatone to analyze the web application's visual aspects.
   - **Example Analysis**: Compare screenshots from both tools and review the visual report for insights into the application's appearance and potential issues.

**Notes**:
- Ensure that Eyewitness and Aquatone are up-to-date.
- Verify that the tools have the necessary permissions to access and capture the web application content.
- Handle any errors or issues that arise during the screenshot capture and analysis.

# Prepare the input message
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt_content}]
formatted_prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)

# Generate the output
output = model.generate(formatted_prompt)
print(output)
```


Loading the Model and Tokenizer: The script initializes the Llama 3 8B model and tokenizer from VLLM and Hugging Face, respectively.

Defining the Prompt: The prompt describes the task of creating a workflow for taking and analyzing screenshots using Eyewitness and Aquatone. It includes detailed instructions for setup, execution, and result analysis.

Preparing the Input Message: The prompt is formatted using the tokenizerâ€™s apply_chat_template method to prepare it for model inference.

Generating the Output: The model generates the workflow based on the provided prompt.

## Example Output

The output from the model might look like this:

```
**Screenshot Workflow: Eyewitness + Aquatone**

1. **Tool Setup**:
   - **Install Eyewitness and Aquatone**:
     - **Eyewitness**: `pip install eyewitness`
     - **Aquatone**: `gem install aquatone`
     - **Configuration**: Ensure both tools are correctly installed and accessible from the command line.

2. **Taking Screenshots with Eyewitness**:
   - **Command**: `eyewitness --web --urls https://example.com --output /path/to/output`
   - **Expected Output**:
     - Screenshots of the specified URLs will be saved in the directory `/path/to/output`.

3. **Analyzing Screenshots with Aquatone**:
   - **Command**: `aquatone -d example.com -out /path/to/aquatone/output`
   - **Expected Output**:
     - A report will be generated, including screenshots and visual analysis of the web application.

4. **Analyze Results**:
   - **Combine Outputs**: Review the screenshots from Eyewitness and the visual report from Aquatone to understand the web application's appearance and any potential issues.
   - **Example Analysis**: Compare the visual data from both tools and use the Aquatone report to gain insights into the application's design and functionality.

**Notes**:
- Ensure both tools are up-to-date and properly configured.
- Check permissions and network access for capturing web application content.
- Address any issues encountered during the screenshot capture or analysis processes.
