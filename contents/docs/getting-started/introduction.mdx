Adversarial Knowledge Workflow Suite (AKWS) is a comprehensive framework designed to provide both red and blue teams with a structured template for simulating cyber-attacks and defending against them using machine learning techniques. The suite consists of various modules, each targeting a specific aspect of cyber-security, from basic attacks like password spraying to advanced persistent threats like the Golden Ticket attack. The modules are named sequentially from AK1 to AK47, where each module addresses a distinct attack vector or defensive measure.

## Modules
`AK`: Offensive and Defensive Terraform Templates 

`LIYA`: Bugbounty LLMs
