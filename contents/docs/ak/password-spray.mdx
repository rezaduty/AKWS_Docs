description:
---

The AK1 Password Spray tool is designed to simulate a password spray attack. This type of attack involves attempting a few common passwords against a large number of accounts. The goal is to avoid triggering account lockouts by spreading the login attempts across many accounts and to detect weak or commonly used credentials.

## Features:

Customizable List of Common Passwords:

Users can define and customize a list of common passwords to be used during the attack. This allows the tool to target passwords that are frequently used and likely to be weak.
Configurable Rate Limits:

The tool provides options to configure rate limits, mimicking real-world attack scenarios. This feature helps in simulating attacks at various speeds, allowing users to test how their systems handle different rates of login attempts.
Logging and Reporting:

AK1 includes comprehensive logging and reporting functionalities. Successful login attempts are recorded, and detailed reports are generated, providing insights into which accounts were compromised. This helps in identifying and addressing weak credentials within the system.

```python
# Basic command to run AK1 with a list of common passwords and a target account list
ak1 --passwords common_passwords.txt --accounts target_accounts.txt --rate-limit 5

# Sample command to generate a detailed report
ak1 --passwords common_passwords.txt --accounts target_accounts.txt --rate-limit 5 --report

```
